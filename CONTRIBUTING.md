If you’re interested in contributing to Packstack, thank you! – there’s much yet to be done :)

To contribute, you can either choose one of the roadmap features to work on or develop your own feature. If you plan to add your own feature, please check with the project’s maintainer first to ensure that your feature will get approved: [jerad@packstack.io](mailto:jerad@packstack.io)

The frontend application requires Typescript interfaces to be written for new components. If you don't know Typescript, you may use the `any` type as a placeholder for your PRs and someone will help you define the types prior to completing a PR.
